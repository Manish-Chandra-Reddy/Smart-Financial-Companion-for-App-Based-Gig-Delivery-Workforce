# Smart-Financial-Companion-for-App-Based-Gig-Delivery-Workforce

Specific Problem Statement
India’s 7–8 million gig workers—like delivery riders and ride-hailing drivers—face unstable
earnings due to opaque algorithms, delayed payments, penalties, and rising costs. Most remain
outside formal finance: under 20% access credit, insurance adoption is minimal, and trust in
fintech is low. Current financial products don’t fit their unpredictable income, leaving them
exposed to debt, emergencies, and limited financial growth.

Focusing on our specific segment —
App-based delivery riders in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities like Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, men aged
20–50 using entry-level Android phones speaking Gujarati/ Telugu/ Hindi/ English with a net
earning of ₹16k–35k/monthly. Despite near-universal UPI and basic bank accounts, riders with
irregular cashflows struggle to build emergency savings and stay adequately insured/invested.
Low literacy, complex UIs, and fraud fears reduce trust and usage, causing mid-cycle cash
stress and greater reliance on informal credit.

Target User Segment & Pain Points
User Segment:
- Occupation: App-based riders in Swiggy/Zomato; Zepto/Blinkit/Instamart; and
Amazon/Flipkart; etc.

Top pain points:
- Irregular cashflows & payout delays → daily earnings fluctuate with order volume,
platform incentives, and penalties; difficult to plan or save.
- Low financial literacy & digital distrust → limited awareness of govt schemes or
fintech solutions, fear of fraud/UI complexity [i.e. English jargons and dense screens
create confusion].
